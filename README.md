# Lagrange-Interpolating-Polynomial
Using Lagrange Polynomials to interpolate a polynomial from raw data. Code is in C++.

See animal.txt.
Its contents is data formatted in the following fashion: ID#, day#, food provided (g), food consumed (g), happiness score, selfie count.

Basically assume that an animal exists that allows humans to take selfies with it. The more well fed it is, the happier it is, the more selfies it takes with humans.

An organization exists that helps keep this wildlife from extinction. They need to provide as little food as possible so as not to waste money and resources. However, they also need to provide enough food so as to keep the animal happy. If these contraints are not met, the organization will not be able to suppress the animals extinction.
