# Lagrange-Interpolating-Polynomial
This code was written to predict a feeding schedule for some friendly craetures of this earth that appear to like to take selfies with humans. It is assumed that data, listed in the .txt and .csv file, is collected by a non-profit organization dedicated to servicing these kind creatures. The measurements include amount of food prepared/comsumed, an id# for each animal, and a 'happines score'. The higher the happines score, the more selfies these animals take with humans. This in turn creates more money donated to the non-profit organization, which will then be able to care for more animals! This code helps determine how much food to prepare for each animal while minimizing the amount of unfinished food while maximizing the ratio of # of selfies taken to total kilograms of food prepared for each animal.
